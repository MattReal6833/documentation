# Configuration
This page goes over the `settings.yml` configuration and setting up the Nginx webserver for Dashactyl.

## Configuring your Settings
Because the `settings.yml` file is so large, this page will break down and explain each individual section.

```yaml
website:
  port: 4440
  secret: 'Enter your session password here.'
  secure: false

discord:
  id: "Enter your Discord OAuth2 ID here."
  secret: "Enter your Discord OAuth2 secret here."
  callbackpath: "http://localhost:4440/accounts/callback"
  prompt: false 

  token: "Insert your bot token here."
  guild: "000000000000000000"
```

The start of the settings file; The `port` is where Dashactyl will be running. Your Discord credentials can be found [at the developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) with the application you are using for Dashactyl. When setting up the `callbackpath`, make sure it is also whitelisted in the portal: __Your Application > Oauth2 > Redirects__. The `token` is the token of your bot application for Dashactyl. This must be kept secret __at all times__ as it can be easily abused. The `guild` is your server ID if applicable. This is optional and is used to add clients to your server when logging into the dashboard.

```yaml
auditlogs:
  enabled: false
  webhook_url: "Enter your webhook URL"
```

This section is for configuring audit logs in Dashactyl. 
`enabled` will determine if you want to activate this system or not, to activate it you must leave it in `true`, to deactivate it in `false`. `webhook_url` is the URL of your webhook, in this case you must put the URL of the webhook created on your Discord server.

```yaml
email_system:
  enabled: false
  smtp_host: "Enter your SMTP Host"
  smtp_port: "Enter your SMTP Port"
  smtp_user: "Enter your SMTP User"
  smtp_password: "Enter your SMTP Password"
  extra:
    dashboardurl: "Enter your dashboard url with https"
    dashboardname: "Dashactyl" 
```

This section is for the configuration of the email system, better known as SMTP in Dashactyl.
For this to work you will need to have an SMTP host like Mailjet.
`enabled` will determine if you want to activate this system or not, to activate it you must leave it in `true`, to deactivate it in `false`.
`smtp_host` will determine the host you are using, example: smtp.zoho.com or smtp.gmail.com
`smtp_port` will determine the port your host uses, in some cases it can be `25`, `465`, etc.
`smtp_user` is the user provided by your SMTP host, in some cases it can be your email.
`smtp_password` It is the password that gives you to connect through the previously configured user, in some cases it is the password of your email placed in `smtp_user`.
`dashboardurl` is the URL of your Dashactyl instance, for example: `https://client.mydomain.com`.
`dashboardname` is the name of your host or dashboard, by default this will be Dashactyl.

```yaml
pterodactyl:
  domain: "Enter your Pterodactyl Panel domain here."
  key: "Enter your Pterodactyl Panel application API key here."
  generate_password_on_sign_up: true
```

This section focuses on the panel side of configuration. `domain` is your Pterodactyl domain. This must be prefixed with `https://` to work. If you are hosting locally then `localhost:<PORT>` can be used (with additional paths if applicable). `key` is the Pterodactyl Application API key for Dashactyl. This can be found or created by going to `your.pterodactyl.domain/admin/api`. This must be kept secret __at all times__ as it can be used to expose confidential information and destroy your panel. `generate_password_on_sign_up` is whether to create a new password for new accounts or use a default password.

```yaml
database:
  host: "Enter your database IP here."
  port: "Enter your database port here."
  user: "Enter your database user here."
  password: "Enter your database password here."
  database: "dashactyl"
```

You may get asked, how do I create a database? Well.. It's fairly simple, just run the commands below. Remember you can change the username and/or the database name, but you'll need to set them on the settings.yml to whatever you've set the user/database name to.
```sql
mysql -u root -p

# After you've got that setup, let's go into the next step. Remember to change 'YourPasswordHere' with a secure password.
CREATE USER 'dashboard'@'127.0.0.1' IDENTIFIED BY 'YourPasswordHere'; 
CREATE DATABASE dashactyl;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON dashactyl.* TO 'dashboard'@'127.0.0.1' WITH GRANT OPTION;
quit;
```
This section is for setting up the MySQL/MariaDB database for Dashactyl.

```yaml
api:
  apicodepassword:
    user info: true
    blacklist user: true
    unblacklist user: true
    set coins: true
    set package: true
    set resources: true
    create coupon: true
    revoke coupon: true
```

This section is for managing the Dashactyl API endpoints. Each option toggles whether the endpoint can be used publicly.

```yaml
locations:
  "1":
    name: "Location Name"
    enabled: true
    package: null

    # package:
    # - default
    # - another_package_name

    renewal: true
```

This section is for the location used for creating the servers on Pterodactyl.

`"1"` is the location ID, you can find it on your Pterodactyl Panel, inside the admin area. `Locations -> Search your location, and you should see the ID on the left.`
`name` is the location name that you want to show while creating a server on Dashactyl.
`enabled` is pretty self-explanatory. It means if the location is enabled or not inside Dashactyl.
`package` checks if a user has a package on his account. If the user doesn't have the specified package in Dashactyl, the user won't be able to create the server in that location. 


```yaml
eggs:
  paper:
    display: "Paper"
    minimum:
      memory: 100
      disk: 100
      cpu: 10
    maximum:
      memory: null
      disk: null
      cpu: null
    info:
      egg: 3
      docker_image: quay.io/pterodactyl/core:java
      startup: java -Xms128M -Xmx{{SERVER_MEMORY}}M -Dterminal.jline=false -Dterminal.ansi=true -jar {{SERVER_JARFILE}}
      environment:
        SERVER_JARFILE: 'server.jar'
        BUILD_NUMBER: 'latest'
      feature_limits:
        databases: 1
        backups: 1
```

This section is for the server configuration eggs in Pterodactyl. When creating a server through Dashactyl, the package associated with this egg will be used to create it. You can set this to your liking, and/or remove the default egg to change it with another one.

```yaml
packages:
  default: "default"
  list:
    default:
      display: "The package name."
      memory: 1024
      disk: 1024
      cpu: 100
      servers: 1
    pro:
      display: "Pro Package"
      memory: 2048
      disk: 2048
      cpu: 200
      servers: 2
```

The packages displayed when a user is creating a server through Dashactyl. These packages can be customised and used with Dashactyl's currency system. The options shown are the specifications for the server(s) that will be given to the user in that package.

```yaml
store:
  memory:
    enabled: true
    cost: 10
    per: 10

  disk:
    enabled: true
    cost: 10
    per: 10

  cpu:
    enabled: true
    cost: 10
    per: 10

  servers:
    enabled: true
    cost: 10
    per: 10
```

This section is for the Dashactyl store configuration. `enabled` is whether the item should be purchasable in the shop. `cost` is how much the item costs and `per` is the amount of that item to give per purchase.

```yaml
afk:
  domain_lock: 
    - localhost:4440
  redirect_on_attempt_to_steal_code: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ

  everywhat: 60
  gaincoins: 1

renewal:
  renewal_time: 6.048e+8
  deletion_time: 8.64e+7

  renew_fee: 10
```
This section is for the AFK page and the server renewal. More information is provided below.

AFK page:

`domain_lock` (WIP)
`redirect_on_attempt_to_steal_code` (WIP)
`everywhat` means how much time must go by before a user is able to get a coin inside the AFK page. The time is in seconds.
`gaincoins` this means how many coins will the user gain after the time you specified goes by. The time is in seconds.

Renewal:
`renewal_time` this is the time that specifies when the server must be renewed.
`deletion_time` deletion time is the time that is given to the user to renew the server after it gets suspended. If the user doesn't renew the server on the specified time after it gets suspended, the server will be deleted. The time is in seconds.
`renew_fee` is the renew fee users will need to use when renewing a server, also known as using coins. The time is in seconds.

## Setting Up Nginx
The Nginx web server will allow us to use a custom domain name and apply SSL to it.

First, we need to make sure you have `Nginx` and `certbot` installed:
```bash
sudo apt install nginx
sudo apt install certbot
sudo apt install -y python3-certbot-nginx
```

Now you can install your SSL certificate:
```bash
systemctl start nginx
certbot certonly --nginx -d <DASHACTYL_DOMAIN>
```

Make sure to replace `<DASHACTYL_DOMAIN>` with your domain name. If you have done this correctly you should see something similar to the following:
```
IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/your.dashactyl.domain/fullchain.pem
   Your key file has been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/your.dashactyl.domain/privkey.pem
   Your cert will expire on date. To obtain a new or tweaked
   version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot
   again. To non-interactively renew *all* of your certificates, run
   "certbot renew"
 - If you like Certbot, please consider supporting our work by:

   Donating to ISRG / Let's Encrypt:   https://letsencrypt.org/donate
   Donating to EFF:                    https://eff.org/donate-le
```
If what you saw isn't similar to what you saw in your server, we recommend you ask for support on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/wwpRNvkMHA).

Next, if everything's going correctly, you need to go to the Nginx sites directory and create a configuration file:
```bash
cd /etc/nginx/sites-available
nano dashactyl.conf
```

Now paste the following into the file. Make sure to replace `<DOMAIN>` and `<PORT>` with your Dashactyl domain and the port Dashactyl is running on.
```conf
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name <URL>;
  return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}
server {
  listen 443 ssl http2;

  location /afkwspath/ {
    proxy_pass "http://localhost:<PORT>/afkwspath";
    proxy_read_timeout     60;
    proxy_connect_timeout  60;
    proxy_redirect         off;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
  }

    server_name <URL>;
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/<URL>/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/<URL>/privkey.pem;
    ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;
    ssl_protocols SSLv3 TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
    ssl_ciphers  HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

    location / {
      proxy_pass http://localhost:<PORT>/;
      proxy_buffering off;
      proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
      proxy_read_timeout     60;
      proxy_connect_timeout  60;
      proxy_redirect         off;
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
      proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
  }
}
```
After we've setup the main config file, we'll need to symlink it to sites-enabled:
```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/dashactyl.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/dashactyl.conf
```

  Once you have edited, saved, and symlinked your configuration file, restart Nginx with `systemctl restart nginx` and restart Dashactyl. You should see it running on that domain with SSL!
  
## Starting Dashactyl

First we need to install pm2:
```
npm install pm2 -g
```
Now you need to go to the dashboard directory and use:
```
pm2 start index.js
```
